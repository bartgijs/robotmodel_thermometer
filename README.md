# Robotmodel thermometer
This repository stores our implementation of a 4-part ROS network that is used to learn the foundations of ROS and the Kalman filter.
The 4 nodes communicate over the ROS network, so they can run on one or on multiple computers.
The Controller node uses a Kalman implementation to estimate the power that needs to be sent to the Heater to keep the (virtual) water at the same temperature

## Context
This project was built as an introduction to the ROS system using Python and the basic theory behind Kalman filtering
